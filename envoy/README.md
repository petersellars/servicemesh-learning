# Envoy
[Envoy][] is an open-source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud native
applications. It is a high-performance C++ distributed proxy designed for
single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal
data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures.

# Requirements
To run the examples locally, you need the following software installed and
configured:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
* [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)

I use Docker and Docker Compose to set up and run example service topologies,
Git to access the scenarios and curl to send traffic to running services.
