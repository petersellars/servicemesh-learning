# Service Mesh Learning
This repository contains information and examples I used to learn more about
service mesh tools, approaches and patterns.

## What Is a Service Mesh?
A service mesh is a programmable framework that provides capabilities such as
traffic control, service discovery, load balancing, robustness, observability
and security to your service architecture. A service mesh allows services to
offload these capabilities, allowing developers to focus on differentiating
business logic.

## Service Meshes
There are several service mesh implementations. I started my service mesh
learning journey with [Envoy][].

### Envoy
[Envoy][] is an open-source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud native
applications. It is a high-performance C++ distributed proxy designed for
single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal
data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures.
